# MySPStats
Makes API requests to the Spotify Web API to retrieve playlist information and provide insights on playlist usage for streamlined Spotify updates

# What problem are you trying to solve?
- I really enjoy making Spotify playlists. Since 2019, I have made a lot for specific genres, decades, events, and vibes. There are some for just myself, and others for small or big groups
- Unfortunately, now that I have 50+ playlists and 40+ public playlists, it is very difficult to maintain them and keep them fresh. 
- I do a decent job at adding new songs to my most listened to playlists, but there are several that I have not updated in 2+ years (when I last did a mass update). 
- That means there are a lot of playlists I don’t listen to because they have old songs and my music taste changes over time, or it is hard to remember what is on it.
- In the past, I have gone through each one by one, but I don’t have as much time or patience to do this all at once. I would rather stagger out the updates by what is in most need of an update

# What is your ideal general solution as a user?
- Essentially, I want a way to keep track of all of the necessary information or statistics regarding my Spotify playlists so that I can more easily maintain and modify them (add songs, remove songs) to keep them fresh
- It would extremely helpful to have some sort of simple yet visually pleasing UI to display this information in one place, and separate it by different categories
- The most important data I want to keep track of per playlist is:
  - how many songs are on it
  - how many/percentage of songs are old
  - how many/percentage of songs are new
  - when the last time I added a song is
- Everytime I want to see this data, I would like the information to be accurate is possible (real-time)
- The cherry on top would be a way to get notified when a playlist’s statistic reaches a certain benchmark (Example: 50% of songs are 2+ years old, last song added was 1+ year), I would get notified. But I only want to get notified once. Email would be ideal, but text could work too.
- Has to be free. There is no point if I have to spend money (other than my spotify membership of course)
